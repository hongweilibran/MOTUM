This repository serves as the official source for the MOTUM dataset, a sustained effort to make a diverse collection of multi-origin brain tumor MRI scans from multiple centers publicly available, along with corresponding clinical non-imaging data, for research purposes. 


### Download 
The latest dataset can be downloaded from the **[Harvard Dataverse repository](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KUUEWC)**. 


### Data format
The patients are grouped into several tumor categories based on their origins. 
Each patient for any tumor category has the same naming format, such as  

    001-Glioma-AYEY
    
        |  flair.nii.gz

        |  t1.nii.gz

        |  t2.nii.gz

        |  t1ce.nii.gz

        |  flair_seg_label1.nii.gz

        |  t1ce_seg_label2.nii.gz
   
In this case, *001-Glioma-AYEY* is the general patient ID, *001* is the patient number, *Glioma* is the tumor category, 
*AYEY* is the center ID, *flair_seg_label1* is the segmentation mask of Label 1 derived from the FLAIR sequence, and *t1ce_seg_label2* is the segmentation mask of Label 2 derived from the T1-ce sequence. 

### Automated segmentation tool 
We provide a Docker container to segment MR images on your side. 
*segment_one_subject.sh* is the shell script to run the container on one subject. 
Please make sure:
(a) The FLAIR, T1, T1-ce, and T2 images have the same naming format as the *001-Glioma-AYEY* example before. 
(b) The *nvidia-container-toolkit* package is installed corrected. 


### Preprocessing scripts
We provide the shell pre-processing scripts based on existing packages. Please check the 'preprocessing' folder.
